# Xcode11Toolchain
Revert back to Xcode 11 tool chain with this script.

As some of you know, Xcode 12 broke compiling for Arm64e, this is down to the toolchain. To fix this, you can replace it with the Xcode 11 toolchain. To make it super simple, I made a script that replaces it and can also revert it back to Xcode 12 toolchain.

# How to use?
1. Copy and paste the whole script into your Mac terminal and press enter.
2. When asked what option, select number 1 and press enter.
3. This will take a minute or two so be patient.
4. All done.

# How to go back?
1. Copy and paste the whole script into your Mac terminal again and press enter.
2. Now when asked what option, select 2 and press enter. This will revert the changes.
